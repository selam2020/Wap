Javascript Scope Exercises

1. Determine what this Javascript code will print out (without running it):
x = 1;
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = function(a, b, c) {
var x = 10;
document.write(x);
document.write(a);
var f = function(a, b, c) {
b = a;
document.write(b);
b = c;
var x = 5;
}
f(a,b,c);
document.write(b);
 }
c(8,9,10);
document.write(b);
document.write(x);


2. What is the difference between a method and function?

     A function is a piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. the parameters)
     and can optionally return data (the return value). All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed.

    A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object. In most respects it is identical to a function except
    for two key differences:

A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called.
A method is able to operate on data that is contained within the class 
(remembering that an object is an instance of a class - the class is the definition, the object is an instance of that data).


3. What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method?

    “this “ refers the current object instantiated by class 

4. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method?
     
       “this “ refers to the owner object

5. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript constructor function?

       ‘this’ refers to the new object when the constructor is used to create the object. 

6. Assume object x is the prototype for object y in Javascript. Object x has a method f( ) containing keyword 'this'.
When f is called by x.f( ), what does 'this' refer to?


7. What is a free variable in JavaScript?
      Free variable is a variable used in a function that are not local variables nor parameters of that function. 

8. Create an object that has properties with name = "fred" and major="music" and a property that is a function
that takes 2 numbers and returns the smallest of the two, or the square of the two if they are equal.

    var object={name:"fred",major="music",functionProperty:function(n1,n2){
    if(a==b) return (a*a)+(b*b);
    else {return(n1<n2)?n1:n2;
     }
     }
      }


9. Write Javascript code for creating three Employee objects using the "new" keyword and a constructor function.
Employee objects have the following fields: name, salary, position.

function Employee(name,salary,position){

this.name=name;
this.salry=salry;
this.position=position; 
}
var Employee1= new Employee("selam","100,000",developer)
var Employee2= new Employee("yome","150,000",developer)
var Employee3= new Employee("Jhone","200,000",developer)
     
10. Write a Javascript function that takes any number of input arguments and returns the product of the
arguments.
     var i;
     var prod=1;
    function product(){
    for(i=0; i<arguments.length;i++){
       prod=prod*argument[i];
}
    return prod;
      }

11. Write an arrow function that returns the maximum of its three input arguments.
function findMax(){

}
