Javascript Scope Exercises

1. Determine what this Javascript code will print out (without running it):
x = 1;
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = function(a, b, c) {
var x = 10;
document.write(x);  10
document.write(a);   8
var f = function(a, b, c) {
b = a;
document.write(b);  8
b = c;
var x = 5;
}
f(a,b,c);
document.write(b);  9
 }
c(8,9,10);
document.write(b);  10
document.write(x);   1

       10,8,8,9,10,1


2. What is the difference between a method and function?

 a method is a function that belongs to a class. In JavaScript, however,
 a function that belongs to an object.
 Everything in JavaScript is an object; a function is an object; an Array is an object.
A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition.


3. What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method?

    this refers the current object instantiated by class 

4. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method?
     
  this refers to the "owner" of the function.    

5. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript constructor function?
The keyword this inside the constructor function points
to the newly created object.



6. Assume object x is the prototype for object y in Javascript. Object x has a method f( ) containing keyword 'this'.
When f is called by x.f( ), what does 'this' refer to?

'this' refers to x.


7. What is a free variable in JavaScript?
      Free variable is a variable used in a function that are not local variables nor parameters of that function. 

8. Create an object that has properties with name = "fred" and major="music" and a property that is a function
that takes 2 numbers and returns the smallest of the two, or the square of the two if they are equal.

    var object={name:"fred",major="music",functionProperty:function(n1,n2){
    if(a==b) return (a*a)+(b*b);
    else {return(n1<n2)?n1:n2;
     }
     }
      }


9. Write Javascript code for creating three Employee objects using the "new" keyword and a constructor function.
Employee objects have the following fields: name, salary, position.

function Employee(name,salary,position){

this.name=name;
this.salry=salary;
this.position=position; 
}
var Employee1= new Employee("selam","100,000","developer")
var Employee2= new Employee("yome","300,000","developer")
var Employee3= new Employee("Jhone","200,000","developer")
     
10. Write a Javascript function that takes any number of input arguments and returns the product of the
arguments.
     var i;
     var prod=1;
    function product(){
    for(i=0; i<arguments.length;i++){
       prod=prod*argument[i];
}
    return prod;
      }

11. Write an arrow function that returns the maximum of its three input arguments.


var max=  ()=> {return x>y||x>z?x:y>x||y>z?y:z
