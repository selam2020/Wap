        "Ditching the cheeky, self-aware wink that helped
        to excuse the concept's inherent corniness, the

        the been-there animation can't compete with the
        edge puppetry of the 1990 live-action movie.

        The turtles themselves may look prettier, but are no smarter; torn irreparably from their countercultural roots,
        our superheroes on the half shell have been firmly co-opted by the industry their creators
