JSP Introduction Quiz 

1.	What is the main value of Java Server Pages? 

Ans-
JavaServer Pages (JSP) are a technology for developing web pages that support dynamic content, allowing developers to insert java code in HTML pages by making use of special JSP tags, most of which start with <% and end with %>.


2.	How are JSP pages related to servlets? 

Ans-
SERVLETS AS:
1.	Servlet is a java class.
2.	Servlet is a single instance multiple thread web application, In which HTML code can be included in java code.
3.	In servlets the presentation logic and the B.logic is tightly coupled.
4.	For every modification done in servlet program, we need to recompile and reload the application.
5.	In servlets implicit objects are not available.
6.	Servlets are supported to HTTP, FTP, and SMTP protocols.
7.	Servlets are need Deployment Descriptor file (web.xml)
JSP AS:
1.	Jsp is a file.
2.	In jsp java code can be included in HTML code by using special tags.
3.	In jsp's the presentation logic and B.logic are separated by defining the java beans.
4.	If any modifications done in jsp's without recompiling and reloading, the modifications are reflected.
5.	In jsp's implicit objects are available which is we can implement directly into jsp pages.
6.	Jsp are supported to HTTP protocol only.
7.	No need of Deployment Descriptor file (web.xml) 


3.	How are JSP pages related to HTML? 
Ans-
   insert java code in HTML pages by making use of special JSP tags, most of which start with <% and end with %>.
1.	   A JSP page consists of HTML tags and JSP tags while HTML can only have html tags.
2.	A JSP page can generate & contain dynamic information while regular HTML cannot.



4.	Give an example of a JSP scriptlet and show how it will look in the JSP servlet .
         Ans-

   <%
  String author = request.getParameter("author");
  if (author != null && !author.equals(""))) { 
%>
    <p>You have choose author <%= author %></p>
<%
  }
%>
In the converted servlet, the above will be inserted into the service() method as follows:
String author = request.getParameter("author");
if (author != null && !author.equals(""))) {
  out.write("<p>You have choose author ");
  out.print( author );
  out.write("</p>");
}


5.	Give an example of a JSP declaration and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.
Ans-
<%! private int count; %>
<%! public int incrementCount() { ++count; } %> 
will be translated to:
public final class first_jsp extends org.apache.jasper.runtime.HttpJspBase
      implements org.apache.jasper.runtime.JspSourceDependent {
   
   private int count;
   public int incrementCount() { ++count; }
  
   public void _jspInit() { ...... }
  
   public void _jspDestroy() { ......  }

   public void _jspService(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
         throws java.io.IOException, ServletException { ...... }
}


6.	Give an example of a JSP comment and show how it will look in the JSP servlet. 
Ans-
        <%-- JSP comments --%>

              ignored by the JSP engine


7.	Give an example of a JSP expression and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.
Ans-
<%= Math.sqrt(5) %>
<%= item[10] %>
<p>The current data and time is: <%= new java.util.Date() %></p>
The above JSP expressions will be converted to:
out.print( Math.sqrt(5) );
out.print( item[10] );
out.write("<p>Current time is: ");
out.print( new java.util.Date() );
out.write("</p>");

8.	Give an example of a JSP directive and show how it will look in the JSP servlet. 
Ans-
<%page import =”packageName.className”>
Translate in to Jsp servlet 
     Import packageName.className;
Placed at the top of the  class servlet


9.	Explain how an EL expression is evaluated. 
Ans-
An EL expression is a compact expression of a systematic evaluation of the page, request, session and application scopes.
           <  %= ((Person) request.getAttribute(“person”)).getDog().getName() %>

           EL simplifies JSP expression syntax 
           ${person.dog.name}




10.Explain how servlet attributes are involved in EL expressions.
Ans-
EL simplifies JSP expression syntax 
           ${person.dog.name}
Translate in servlet
Person per = (Person) request.getAttribute(“person”);
out.println(per.dog.name);

 11. Explain how servlets and JSPs use request dispatch to interact. 
  Ans-
        <HTML>
<HEAD> <TITLE> JSP Calling Servlet Demo </TITLE> </HEAD>
<BODY>
<!-- Forward processing to a servlet -->
<% request.setAttribute("empid", "1234"); %>
<jsp:include page="/servlet/MyServlet?user=Smith" flush="true"/>
</BODY>
</HTML>

      request.setAttribute("username", "Smith");
RequestDispatcher rd = sc.getRequestDispatcher("/jsp/mypage.jsp");
